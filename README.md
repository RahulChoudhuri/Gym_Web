## Technologies Used


- **HTML5**: Structure and content of the website.

- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness (media queries).

- **JavaScript**: Interactivity, including the navigation menu toggle and form validation.

### Features Overview

1. **Navigation Menu**:
The navigation menu is responsive. On mobile, it collapses into a hamburger-style menu.
It includes links to key sections of the website such as Home, Services, and Contact.

2. **Hero Section**:
Features a large background image with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.
The background image resizes and adapts to different screen sizes.
3. **Services Section**:
Displays various services provided by the gym (e.g., personal training, group fitness classes).
Each service has a description and accompanying image.
4. **Contact Form**:
A simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
JavaScript is used for basic form validation (e.g., checking if fields are filled).
5. **Footer Section**:
Includes gym’s address, contact information, and social media links.
The footer content is stacked vertically on smaller screens for better readability.
How It Works
HTML (index.html)
The index.html file is the main structure of the website. It includes:

The header with a logo and navigation menu.
The hero section with an introductory message.
The services section that outlines available services.
A contact form for inquiries.
A footer with social media and contact links.
CSS (style.css)
The style.css file is used to style the page elements:

It defines the layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness using media queries.
The website is optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent design on all devices.
JavaScript (script.js)
The script.js file provides interactivity:

- **Hamburger Menu:** The menu toggle functionality is implemented using JavaScript for small screens.
Form Validation: JavaScript checks if required fields are filled in the contact form before submission.
Responsiveness
CSS Media Queries are used to make the website responsive.
The layout adjusts for screens of different sizes, with a collapsible menu and stacked content on smaller screens.
Customization
To personalize the website for your gym or fitness business, you can:

- **Modify the Text:** Change the text content in index.html for different sections (Hero, Services, Contact).
Update Images: Replace the images in the images/ folder with your own. Be sure to update the image paths in the HTML file.
Change Styles: Adjust the colors, fonts, and layout in style.css to match your brand’s aesthetic.
Add More Services: You can add additional services in the Services section by duplicating and modifying the HTML structure.
